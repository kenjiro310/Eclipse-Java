Okay soooo. So far I have created a splash screen that opens up a new window automatically
once the allotted time has elapsed. On that screen there are two buttons which will allow
the user to either enter or exit the system. When the user press enter the login window will 
open. I finally figured out how to connect to the database. I created a test database so I
wouldn't mess up the one already created. But if you enter the username or password the 
appropriate window will open based on who the user is and the permissions stored in the database. 
I am confused now on how to incorporate Don and Dustins portion into everything but ill keep working on it.
